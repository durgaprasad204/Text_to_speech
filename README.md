This project is a Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application featuring a simple graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to input text and convert it into speech, with options to customize voice settings such as speed and pitch. The application uses the gTTS library to generate speech and Tkinter for the GUI, making it easy to use and accessible for various purposes. Users can also play back the generated speech directly within the app or save it as an audio file for later use. This project is ideal for those interested in exploring TTS technologies or building custom speech applications.
